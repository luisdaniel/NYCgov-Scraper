The script has two arrays, "start" and "end". For some reason the URL format is split after the first of July of each year. 

To update and scrape the most current press releases, update the last elements of the "start" and "end" array (one 'end' and 'start' number for each year 2002-2013)
.

The search terms are at the bottom of the script.
